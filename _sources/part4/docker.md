# Publishing Docker image for your package 
Publishing a [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container-image) is perhaps one of the best ways to make sure that people are able to run your package in exactly the same environment as you.

## Github Packages
Github Packages is an integrated feature, which can link a repository to a set of Docker images.
See [Publishing to Github Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-github-packages) for more information

You can choose if the image is public or private, see [Access control](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility) for more information.

## DockerHub
There are [Github workflows](../part2/github.md) for [publishing to DockerHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-docker-hub).
