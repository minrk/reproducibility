This repository is a template for how to set up a reproducible python environment with GitHub.

## Python-packaging

To be able to create a python package, we need a folder with the name of the package (in this repository `mypackage`), and a `pyproject.toml` file.



## Make a repository citable
The easiest way to make your repository citable is to add a `CITATION.cff` file to the repository, as it is supported by both 
[Zenodo's](https://zenodo.org/) and it's [Github integration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) and [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) itself.

## Adding an issue template
See [Adding an issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) for more information.
