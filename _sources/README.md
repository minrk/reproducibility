## Badges

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jorgensd/reproducibility/gh-pages?labpath=_sources)

To get the `Launch Binder` badge, go to: [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/) and fill in (specifics for this repo in brackets):
- Your Github repository (https://github.com/jorgensd/reproducibility)
- Git ref (`gh-pages`, see: [How to create github pages](#ghpages))
- Path to notebook file (`_sources`, as generated by `jupyter-book`, see [Jupyter-book](#jupyterbook))

Then press `Launch`, and then `Expand to see the text below, paste it into your README to show a binder badge` and copy the markdown code. If you render the README.md file as plaintext, you can see all the settings explicitly in the image link

## Python-packaging

To be able to create a python package, we need a folder with the name of the package (in this repository it is called `mypackage`, located under `src/mypackage`), and a `pyproject.toml` file.


## Make a repository citable
The easiest way to make your repository citable is to add a `CITATION.cff` file to the repository, as it is supported by both 
[Zenodo's](https://zenodo.org/) and it's [Github integration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) and [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) itself.

## Adding an issue template
See [Adding an issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) for more information.
